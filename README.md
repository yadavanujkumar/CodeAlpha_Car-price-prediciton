# CodeAlpha Car Price Prediction

This repository contains code and analysis for predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. The project is developed using Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. 
The analysis and model development are documented in the `analysis.ipynb` notebook.

## Repository Structure

- `analysis.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
